Hello.  My name is Brian Ebers.  After having committed two years in the cable industry in the role of technical support specialist I decided to engage online coding as a professional hobby.  At the least I hope the files I have provided will demonstrate a level of computing competence.  At the current time I mainly involved with the freecodecamp.org curriculum.  
I have spent a couple of years learning Spanish mostly thru listening and reading Spanish books at work between calls.  I do speaking with spanish callers every day and although I am not fully fluent my goal is to be functionally fluent prior to 2025.
In addition to freecodecamp.org I am involved in a few other learning platorms like hackthebox.com, The Odin Project, and learning the beginnings of front end development.  Likewise I am able to work in a Linux environment and use Linux virtual machines on my home computer.
