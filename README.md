Hi.  I'm Brian.  My interests are networking and spanish.  In the past 2 years with Spectrum technical support I was promoted twice to tier 3.  I am currently preparring for the CompTIA A+ certifications and become more fully literate with the Spanish language.  I aspire to combine the two skills in a future role.  My work challenges me to spontaneously interact with our clients and customer.   In addition to my current status I spend time, on my own, exploring opportunities online to expand my understanding of compuuting, coding, and networking.  I have been engaged with websites like hack the box and Free Code Camp.
While my work at Spectrum compensates well and provides challenging situations to learn and grow i feel I have plateaued with the company and feel called to explore the field of opportunities.
I am a loyal employee with an inspired ability to use humor in difficult situations, to refrain from complaint generally, and have adopted an attitude of servility in my capacty of Tech support.
I am only looking for an opportunity to demostrate my value and worth working in any capacity , on site, hybrid, work from home.
